~Pig Game~
A game of pig where a human player plays against a simple computer which can only 
roll the dice once per turn.

Prerequesites:
JavaFX version installed your system and referenced in the VM argument.

Technologies Used:
-Java
-JavaFX
-Eclipse

To-do:
-Add methods to model classes to facilitate more thorough testing.

Notes: 
-I did my best to add documentation and test what I could on all the classes I 
co-authored, but I wanted to focus more on the To-Do's for this assignment. I plan on 
adding more JUnit testing for the other model classes so that my final application
meets industry standards.
-Methods with random number results or JavaFx data types were tested in the GUI.
-The ComputerPlayer class testing included most of the abstract class methods which
are also used in the HumanPlayer class, which is why I only tested it for the one class.
