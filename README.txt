roll the dice once per turn.

Prerequesites:

VM Argument
--module-path "${eclipse_home}/javafx-sdk-14.0.2.1/lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml

Technologies Used:
-Java
-JavaFX
-Eclipse

To-do:
-Add methods to model classes to facilitate more thorough testing.

Notes: 
-I originally dowloaded version 14.0.2.1 of javafx when we first started learning it
and found that it worked for me in VLab for this project. If it's a fluke for some 
reason, I can still try using/copying version 11.0.2 and renaming it as per the FAQ 
instructions in my next submission.
-I plan on adding more JUnit testing for the model classes I didn't co-author 
so that my final application meets industry standards.
-Methods with random number results or JavaFx data types were tested in the GUI.
